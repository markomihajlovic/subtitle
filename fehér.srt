1
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,934
Clark?

2
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,539
- Where have you been?
- We've been looking for you.

3
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,239
- I've been out.
- Hey. Hey, son.

4
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,907
What is going on with you?

5
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,780
You've been acting strange all week.

6
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,354
It's like your mind's somewhere else.
What's up?

7
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,691
When I woke up this morning,
I was in the middle of Route 8.

8
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,033
How did you get there?

9
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,233
I don't know.

10
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:04,067
Lex almost hit me with his car.
He gave me a ride home.

11
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,901
Lex.

12
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,744
Told him I was sleepwalking, but I'm not
sure how much walking was involved.

13
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,411
I've been having this dream all week.

14
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,181
I'm flying over Smallville.

15
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,725
I always end up at the cave.
It's like it's calling out to me...

16
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,657
...trying to give me answers.

17
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,762
Answers to what, Clark?

18
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,431
I'm not sure.

19
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:33,498
But in my dream I take the key
and I put it in the slot in the cave wall...

20
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,039
...then there's this bright light.

21
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,269
- And?
- I don't know, that's when I wake up.

22
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,308
Clark.

23
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,280
Dreaming about putting that key
in a rock wall is one thing...

24
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,081
...but we have no idea
what would happen if you did that.

25
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,520
These dreams are getting
more intense every night.

26
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,525
- Who knows where I'll wake up tomorrow.
- It's too dangerous.

27
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,263
That cave could have
all the answers I'm looking for.

28
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,422
Why are you so afraid to let me find out?

29
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,765
I gotta get dressed for school.

30
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,284
Dr. Walden.

31
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:27,385
I got a call this morning
from the State Preservation Society.

32
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,620
They heard a rumor that you plan
on removing a section of the wall.

33
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:36,869
Now, I told them you wouldn't consider
such a radical move without consulting me.

34
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,867
It's a common archeological practice.

35
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,970
Among 19th-century imperialists.

36
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,604
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were
trying to cut me out of the process.

37
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,337
You're paranoid.

38
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:49,909
Really?

39
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,511
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't fire you right now.

40
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,688
Because I'm on the verge
of a major breakthrough.

41
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,386
Will this breakthrough finally allow you
to translate these symbols?

42
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,463
It's hard to say...

43
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,657
...now that I won't be able
to get a sample back to my lab.

44
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,662
Who tipped off the state?

45
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:18,541
The state is threatening to revoke LexCorp's
custodial management of the cave.

46
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,544
Another foundation is chomping
at the bit to take over.

47
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,774
If my instincts are correct,
I believe my father is behind it.

48
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:28,011
I don't need excuses, I need answers.

49
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,018
You've got three days.

50
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,653
What a lame assignment.
Family trees are so 20th century.

51
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,889
Look at it as a mystery. You never know
what you're gonna uncover.

52
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,899
- Why are you so excited?
- It's gonna be a piece of cake.

53
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,799
Your family's been in Smallville
since the Jurassic era.

54
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,303
What are you worked up about?

55
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,931
There's just so many variables, like
what if your mother abandoned you...

56
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,544
...is that branch of your family tree cut off?

57
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,738
What if your biological father comes back...

58
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,246
...which family do you claim?

59
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,409
- What if you're adopted?
- Hey, okay, I get the point...

60
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,350
...but is it my fault that I'm part
of a nuclear family?

61
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,690
Is it? Later.

62
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:09,157
Unfortunately for the rest of us,
nuclear family was nuked years ago.

63
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,855
We should get together at the Talon
tomorrow and figure out a game plan.

64
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,132
Clark doesn't like that idea.

65
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,267
Do you guys hear that?

66
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,132
Hear what?

67
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:30,843
That.

68
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,475
Apparently you're part canine,
because we don't hear anything.

69
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,856
- Clark, what is it?
- I gotta go.

70
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,702
Clark...

71
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,341
...are you okay?

72
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,310
Lex, what happened?

73
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,110
I was hoping you could tell me.

74
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,684
What were you doing down here?

75
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:33,597
Just finishing up some work for Dr. Walden,
figured I'd do it while it was quiet...

76
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,193
...next thing I know
you're shaking me awake.

77
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,363
The guard said there was an explosion.

78
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,472
You didn't touch any equipment, did you?

79
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,441
I find it interesting that you managed
to get around the guard in the first place.

80
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:49,047
- What's your secret, Mr. Kent?
- Back off, doctor.

81
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,981
- Can't you see he's been hurt?
- I'm okay, I just need to get some air.

82
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,717
Clark.

83
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,482
First I find you lying in the road,
and now here.

84
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,649
- You should get to the hospital.
- I'm fine.

85
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,852
I just gotta get home
before my parents start to worry.

86
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,495
Okay...

87
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,397
...but until we figure out what happened,
I don't want you down here by yourself.

88
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,700
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.

89
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,935
Why'd you let him walk out of here?

90
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,806
He knows more than he's telling us.

91
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,277
Probably.

92
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,939
But you've got enough
on your plate, doctor.

93
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,608
Let me worry about Clark Kent.

94
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:34,926
Hey, my hard drive just crashed. I was
wondering if I could borrow your computer.

95
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,119
I need to get a start on this assignment.

96
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,628
Yeah, sure, I was just
turning everything off.

97
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,865
So, what are you, a Lang or a Small?

98
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,470
Right now I'm committing
to my mother's side of the family.

99
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,503
Knock yourself out.
I'll see you at home?

100
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,904
- Yeah. Chloe, you're a lifesaver.
- Of course.

101
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,874
Did you give up on genealogy
or is my personal life more interesting?

102
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:29,103
- I was just looking...
- So you decided to snoop around.

103
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,988
Chloe, I'm sorry.

104
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,822
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what way?

105
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:45,987
Like I'm some loser who's trying to hang on
to something that she's never even had.

106
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,135
If you have feelings for Clark,
maybe you should just tell him.

107
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,100
This isn't about me and Clark, Lana.

108
00:12:54,373 --> 00:13:00,175
This is about you violating my privacy. This
office and everything in it is now off-limits.

109
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,143
Oh, and by the way...

110
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,483
...I did tell Clark how I felt.

111
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,524
I poured my heart out to him
when he was sick.

112
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:17,219
And in his delirium,
the one name he called out...

113
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:18,954
...was "Lana."

114
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:28,935
Well, you're up early.

115
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,804
Don't worry, Dad, I woke up
in my own bed this morning.

116
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,467
No dreams?

117
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,139
No, I think whatever it is passed.

118
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,873
That's good.

119
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,778
I'm taking your mother in for her
checkup, want a ride?

120
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,978
- No, Chloe's gonna pick me up.
- Great.

121
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,715
- How's Mom feeling?
- Pregnant.

122
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,493
- I still can't believe it.
- How soon can we start telling everyone?

123
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,823
As soon as your mother says she's ready.

124
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,797
Don't worry, this secret
we can all be very happy to share.

125
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,199
Yeah, the baby's lucky.

126
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,498
Hey, son, I didn't mean
for it to sound that way.

127
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:07,139
This child is going to be
a big adjustment for all of us...

128
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,941
...but it doesn't change
the way we feel about you.

129
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,682
I know that.

130
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,810
I'm just glad things are back to normal.

131
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,252
Jonathan, we're late, we've gotta go!

132
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,180
Jonathan!

133
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,291
I'll get it, I'll get it, go on!

134
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,871
- Clark, what happened?
- I don't know!

135
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,009
What happened?

136
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,310
We came out and it was...

137
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,481
...on fire.

138
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:59,715
That ought to keep lookers away till
we have a chance to patch it up better.

139
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,725
A couple of boards won't be able
to cover anything up anymore.

140
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,090
Especially after Chloe
publishes her pictures.

141
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,664
Well, I think I convinced her it was a prank.

142
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,164
You can't beat yourself up.
Your abilities are still developing.

143
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,861
You can't always control them.

144
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,701
There's nothing uncontrolled
about that drawing.

145
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,435
It's a symbol from wherever I'm from.

146
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,804
It means "hope."

147
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,507
How do you know that?

148
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,948
Since when can you read the symbols?

149
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,752
Since I put the key in the cave wall.

150
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,421
Wait a minute.

151
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,557
- Since you did what?
- It was calling out to me.

152
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,098
It led me to where you hid it.

153
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,791
- I told you not to.
- I know, Dad.

154
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,802
- It was like I didn't have a choice.
- Where is the key now?

155
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:51,572
I don't know. When I put the key in,
there was a blinding light and I blacked out.

156
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,336
- Are you all right?
- It didn't hurt.

157
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,036
But everything's jumbled up.

158
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,750
It's like it downloaded me
with the language from the cave wall.

159
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,612
Did anybody see you?

160
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,845
I don't think so,
but Lex and Dr. Walden found me.

161
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,118
I don't think they have the key.
I think it disintegrated.

162
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,987
You're not 100 percent sure?

163
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,335
Clark, we understand you wanting
to know more about your origins.

164
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,961
- But you're putting your life in danger.
- Some things are worth the risk.

165
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,438
- Like what?
- Like the truth.

166
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,579
Clark.

167
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,619
Earth to Clark.

168
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,392
Are you okay?

169
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,365
I heard about the fire.

170
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,435
It's no big deal.
We got it under control.

171
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,367
I think Chloe's over at the Torch
writing an exclusive.

172
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,872
I wouldn't know. Her and I aren't
exactly talking right now.

173
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,337
Sounds serious.

174
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,473
Well, invasion of privacy usually is.

175
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,212
Let me guess. You caught her
snooping around in your stuff.

176
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:11,313
Actually, I was the one doing the snooping.
I didn't mean to, kind of just happened.

177
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,993
You'd think all the times she's overstepped
the boundaries, she'd cut you some slack.

178
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:20,054
Just reminded me that as great as
Chloe and her dad have been...

179
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,029
...I'm still not family.

180
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,496
Yeah, I know what you mean.

181
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,131
Can I tell you a secret?

182
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,668
That would be a first.

183
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,250
I've been looking into my roots
and it's freaking my parents out.

184
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,717
But I think I'm getting close
to finding out where I'm from.

185
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,620
Then you shouldn't stop.

186
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,022
Is that your family tree?

187
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,329
Clark, what's wrong?

188
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,873
Nothing. I gotta go.

189
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:09,141
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Sorry, Lex, I can't talk right now.

190
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,214
Looks like we've been abandoned.

191
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,551
Story of my life.

192
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:37,197
Lex, I may decipher ancient languages, but
cryptic phone messages don't amuse me.

193
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,844
You're aware that
I'm on a very tight deadline.

194
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,674
I thought you might find this enlightening.

195
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,142
What is it?

196
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:49,449
I'd say somebody has gained knowledge
of the language that's carved in the cave.

197
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,753
These characters are similar...

198
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,656
...but there's no way
to verify their accuracy.

199
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,022
See, these symbols
could be "father"...

200
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,630
...or "mother"...

201
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,130
...or they could just be chicken scratch.

202
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,431
Where'd you get it?

203
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,870
Clark Kent.

204
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,898
What is it with you and this kid, Lex?

205
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,841
I'm a top expert in my field
and I'm telling you...

206
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,070
...these walls will take years to translate.

207
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:18,239
Some Kansas farm boy's scribblings
don't change that.

208
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,451
Then how do you explain this?

209
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,554
I'd say that was more than scribbling.

210
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,385
That's one of the symbols
on the octagonal disk.

211
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,793
Maybe the whole thing's a hoax.

212
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,830
No.

213
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,032
It's no hoax.

214
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,670
Something happened to Clark in that cave.

215
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,829
Well, what do you suggest I do?

216
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:46,000
Put your extravagant ego aside
and work with the boy.

217
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,612
He may be a fraud, doctor...

218
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,806
...or he just might be the Rosetta stone
we've been looking for.

219
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,556
I'd like to thank you
for turning our farm into Area 51.

220
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,325
We needed a couple of deputies
to keep the wackos away.

221
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,333
Sorry, Clark.
You have to admit, it is really intriguing.

222
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:12,970
It's probably a K.U. Frat prank.

223
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:17,438
Or aliens think that crop circles are passe
so they've moved on to barn scorchings?

224
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:22,275
Come on, Clark, this is Smallville.
I mean, you have to consider the possibility.

225
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:31,420
I'll let it go if you forgive Lana
for what she did.

226
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,353
Why didn't I see this coming?

227
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,621
Did she tell you what she was doing?

228
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,127
No, but she did tell me she was very sorry.

229
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,856
- I can't believe...
- You know what?

230
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,127
This is one time when you don't need
to come to Lana's rescue.

231
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,737
Hello.

232
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,873
What's this?

233
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,274
Someone spammed your e-mail account.

234
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,147
But they're all for you.

235
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,448
From someone called "Swann"?

236
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,087
Never heard of him.

237
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,531
- Did my parents see you?
- No.

238
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,433
What's with all this cloak-and-dagger stuff?

239
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,840
How come we didn't just use
Chloe's computer?

240
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:32,110
I can't have her looking over my shoulder
if this Swann has information for me.

241
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,712
Come on.

242
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,252
Okay, you're on.

243
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:03,678
What's wrong?

244
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,650
What if my parents are right?

245
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,582
Dude, we can just pull the plug
on this whole thing.

246
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,290
I need to know.

247
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,477
What's that?

248
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,509
It says, ; ; I'm a friend."

249
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,799
Dr. Walden!
Dr. Walden.

250
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,941
Dr. Walden.

251
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,057
How's he doing?

252
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,595
Doctors have never seen anything like it.

253
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,665
He's completely catatonic.

254
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,372
Is he gonna be okay?

255
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:49,176
It's impossible to determine
without knowing the cause.

256
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:54,777
Three mysterious events in three days
and you were there on each occasion.

257
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,181
That's a mystery unto itself,
don't you think?

258
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,957
Not really.

259
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:03,822
What about that language?
You sure you can't read it?

260
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,462
What would give you that idea?

261
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,121
The symbol on your barn and this.

262
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,298
Just doodling,
it doesn't mean anything.

263
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,732
- Looks pretty specific to me.
- Lex.

264
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,568
Why do you care about a
Native American language?

265
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,605
I don't think it's Native American.

266
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,108
I don't even think it's from this planet.

267
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,944
You think aliens wrote it?

268
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,008
I'd keep that to yourself, Lex.

269
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,918
I'm looking for a Clark Kent.

270
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,319
That's me.

271
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,655
Sign here.

272
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,491
How'd you know I'd be here?

273
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,258
My instructions were to
deliver that to you personally.

274
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,866
Lucky for me, small town.

275
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,470
Aren't you gonna open it?

276
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,440
It's probably just junk mail.
I'll open it later.

277
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:18,896
Dr. Virgil Swann.

278
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,130
- You're being stalked by a legend.
- I've never heard of him.

279
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,741
He was a high-tech
Howard Hughes 30 years ago.

280
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,173
He graduated from MIT when he was 19.

281
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,973
He had his doctorate
in math and applied physics.

282
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,013
Then he started Swann Communications...

283
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:35,016
...which quickly rose to
international acclaim in the '70s...

284
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,484
...as the world's largest producer
of satellites.

285
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,556
This guy has so much hardware in space...

286
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:42,215
...Scientific American dubbed him
"Man of Tomorrow."

287
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,658
"Only through communication
will we live in peace."

288
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,230
- Sounds like a remarkable guy.
- He was, until he pulled a J.D. Salinger.

289
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,369
Sold his company and put millions
towards charitable foundations.

290
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:56,633
Rumor has it he devoted himself to searching
for signs of intelligent life in the universe.

291
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,101
The address on the card,
how does that fit in?

292
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,608
The New York Planetarium.

293
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,114
What better place
to look for little green men?

294
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,178
Why is this guy so interested in you, Clark?

295
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,146
He's not interested in me...

296
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:14,416
...he's just interested in my barn.

297
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:18,684
Virgil Swann hasn't made
a phone call in 13 years...

298
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,832
...and now, all of a sudden,
he wants to be your best friend?

299
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,827
He must think that symbol's
pretty important.

300
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,306
It's just a hoax.

301
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:34,910
Yeah, well, one of the most brilliant men
in the world disagrees.

302
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,446
If I were you, I'd find out why.

303
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,021
Has there been a change
in his condition?

304
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:52,288
Whatever he was exposed to
over-stimulated his cerebral cortex...

305
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:53,988
...causing a massive seizure.

306
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,395
He suffered from information overload?

307
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,559
In layman's terms, yes.

308
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,666
It's doubtful he'll ever regain
consciousness.

309
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,737
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.

310
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,540
Don't worry, doctor.

311
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,480
One day you'll share your secrets with me.

312
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:25,059
If you're planning to run away from home,
you might wanna pack lighter.

313
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,530
This isn't my home, Chloe.

314
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:32,261
As great as you and your dad have been,
I don't think this was such a great idea.

315
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:36,496
You know, Lana, if this is about
the whole computer incident, I'm sorry.

316
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,009
I overreacted, I know...

317
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,702
...but when it comes to Clark...

318
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,839
...and my feelings, I...

319
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,575
I'm never really rational.

320
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:54,083
- I can't help the way Clark feels about me.
- I know.

321
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:01,194
Before you go,
I just wanted to show you something.

322
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,500
It's my family tree.

323
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,609
You put me under "sister."

324
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,847
Why?

325
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:23,950
Because I decided that my family wasn't
about the people that didn't love me...

326
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,987
...it's about the people who do love me.

327
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,254
No matter what.

328
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,018
My friends.

329
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,594
Clark, this whole thing is very suspicious.

330
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,634
He knows how to read the language.

331
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,431
According to you, he does.

332
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,506
How do we know you're reading it right?

333
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,473
We have no idea
what that cave did to you, son.

334
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,743
Mom, help me out here.

335
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:51,040
We don't know anything
about this Dr. Swann.

336
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:54,083
The whole thing could be
an elaborate plan just to get to you.

337
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,277
Now you're just being paranoid.

338
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,648
Did you ever think maybe
he just wanted to help?

339
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,415
No, Clark, I haven't.

340
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,184
When it comes to protecting you...

341
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,852
...all I've seen are people who want
to exploit you for their personal gain.

342
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,999
- You can't protect me forever!
- I'm not ready to give that up.

343
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:18,335
Clark, we're not trying to keep you
from learning about your past.

344
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,875
We just don't want to see you
get hurt, either.

345
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,840
I've got all these questions and I can't
leave them in the storm cellar anymore.

346
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,386
Why did my parents put me in that ship?

347
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,889
What was so bad
they had to send me away?

348
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:41,864
I have to do this.

349
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,199
Then let's go together, we'll go as a family.

350
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,702
Dad, I have to go alone.

351
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,179
It's the only way.

352
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:09,585
No matter what I find out, it is not going
to change how I feel about you.

353
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,830
You're still gonna be my mom and dad.

354
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:36,646
Hello?

355
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,454
Hello, Dr. Swann.

356
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,699
- What am I doing here?
- Looking for answers, I assume.

357
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,453
Hello, Clark.

358
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,161
I've been expecting you.

359
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,624
You're probably wondering
why a billionaire scientist...

360
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,994
...works in the back room
of a planetarium.

361
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,399
The thought had crossed my mind.

362
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,697
Well, I find it peaceful.

363
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,271
Besides, I own the building.

364
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,904
Activate screen.

365
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,815
Does any of that look familiar?

366
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:50,756
What is it?

367
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:54,158
It's a message from the stars, Clark.

368
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:57,760
All my life I've been staring out
into space, wondering.

369
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,634
Wondering, "Is anybody else
out there?" And then...

370
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:03,335
...thirteen years ago, I got an answer.

371
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,165
Day of the meteor shower.

372
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,703
One of my receiving stations
picked up a faint signal.

373
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,114
Took me years to decrypt it...

374
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:18,445
...and finally I discovered
a mathematical key...

375
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,384
...that was built into the transmission.

376
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,722
- Can you read it?
- Yes.

377
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,854
It says, "This is Kal-el of Krypton.

378
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,364
Our infant son, our last hope.

379
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,904
Please protect him
and deliver him from evil."

380
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,173
Kal-el.

381
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,480
Krypton.

382
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:50,212
I've always wondered
what happened to that child.

383
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,355
Did he survive the journey?

384
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,055
If he lived among us.

385
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:58,490
And then, three days ago,
I saw the symbol for hope...

386
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,393
...burned onto the side
of a barn in Smallville.

387
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,090
And I found out
that the farmer and his wife...

388
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,700
...had an adopted son.

389
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,768
So you think I'm Kal-el?

390
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,577
I'm just Clark Kent.

391
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:19,011
No, no, no, I'm not trying
to expose you, Clark, I'm just...

392
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:22,011
I'm just seeking the truth.

393
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,080
Sorry, doctor.

394
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,690
The truth is I'm not who you think I am.

395
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,854
If you can live with that decision, so can I.

396
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,958
But...

397
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,997
...if you walk out that door...

398
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:39,027
...it'll never be open to you again.

399
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,441
Then you'll never know
the second part of the message.

400
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,941
Tell me something, doctor...

401
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,117
...why are you doing this to me?

402
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,683
We all have our windmills, Clark.

403
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,688
I need to know I'm right.

404
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,563
Once I do, it'll never leave this room.

405
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,837
Show me.

406
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,502
Second screen.

407
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,512
; ; We will be with you, Kal-el.

408
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,316
For all the days of your life."

409
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:30,684
What does this mean?

410
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,482
I'm not sure, but...

411
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,920
...one thing I've learned about science
is the value of patience.

412
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,060
Is that where Krypton is?

413
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,169
No, that's where Krypton was.

414
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:49,868
I followed the signal's path
billions of miles out into space.

415
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,033
I was hoping to discover
its origin, but instead...

416
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,840
...I found nothing.

417
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:02,942
Planets just don't disappear.

418
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,656
What do you think happened?

419
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,525
Oh, could be any one of a million
different scenarios.

420
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,827
War, famine, disease.

421
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,003
I mean, look at the world around us.

422
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,098
Is it really that hard to believe?

423
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:30,146
Well, I can't be the only one.
There must be others like me.

424
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,578
There was only one message.

425
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,452
Why me?

426
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:44,493
There must be a reason
why I was sent to this planet.

427
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:48,454
You won't find the answers
by looking to the stars.

428
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,126
It's a journey you'll have to take
by looking inside yourself.

429
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,672
You must write your own destiny...

430
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,437
...Kal-el.

431
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,532
Your mother told me you were back.

432
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,511
Clark.

433
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,775
I know that whatever Dr. Swann
told you must be...

434
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,953
...overwhelming, but...

435
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,782
...if you need to talk about it,
your mother and I are always here.

436
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,189
Ever since you told me about the ship,
I wondered if there were others like me.

437
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,967
Now I know there's not.

438
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,497
I'm totally alone.

439
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,346
Clark.

440
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,415
You're never alone, son.

441
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,314
This is your home
and we love you very much.

442
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,756
- Come on, let's go back up.
- In a minute.

443
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,876
I figured out what this is.

444
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:47,707
It's the ship's heart.

445
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,948
Really?

446
00:39:58,596 --> 00:39:59,790
Have you used it yet?

447
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,424
I didn't want to do it alone.

448
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,467
Let's do it together.

449
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,708
It's hard to believe
you were ever that small.

450
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,767
What is it, son?

451
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,873
It's a message from my biological father.

452
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,782
- I'm sure I'm reading it wrong.
- Why, what does it say?

453
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,120
; ; On this third planet from this star...

454
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:37,385
...Sol, you will be a god among men.

455
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:43,859
They are a flawed race, rule them with
strength. That is where your greatness lies."

456
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,934
I think I was sent here to conquer.

457
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,581
What kind of planet am I from?

458
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,842
Maybe you did misread it, Clark,
but even if you didn't...

459
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,818
...it's you who decides
what kind of life you're gonna lead.

460
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,254
Not me, not your mother, not your...

461
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:09,915
...biological parents.

462
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,355
What if it's part of who I am?

463
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,521
Is that the kind of person I will become?

464
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,064
Clark Kent, you're here
to be a force for good.

465
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:20,328
- Not a force for evil.
- But how can you be so sure?

466
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,472
Because I am your father.

467
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,667
I raised you and I know you
